SwiftSOS is a real-time Earthquake Data Visualization project that uses Folium, Streamlit, and the USGS API. It provides an interactive map for users to explore earthquake data on a global scale.

## Application

- **Streamlit App**: The Streamlit app resides in the `streamlit-app` branch and is deployed on the Streamlit Community Cloud. You can access it at [SwiftSOS Streamlit App](https://uyhvhzhg6qqkiyf6f8qddp.streamlit.app).

## Description

SwiftSOS is a data visualization project that fetches real-time earthquake data from the USGS API and displays it on an interactive map. This project aims to make earthquake data easily accessible and comprehensible to users.

## Requirements

To run this app, you need Python 3.6 or newer, and the following packages:

- `folium`
- `streamlit`

## Features

- Interactive Map: The app provides an interactive map for visualizing earthquake data.
- Real-Time Updates: Earthquake data is fetched in real-time from the USGS API, ensuring that users have access to the latest information.
- Earthquake Heatmap: The app offers a heatmap that shows the distribution of earthquake magnitudes.
- Marker Layers: Different categories of earthquakes are displayed using marker layers, based on their magnitudes on the Richter scale.
- PopUp Information: Users can view detailed information about individual earthquake events, including magnitude, date and time, location address, and coordinates.
- Dark and Light Themes: The app supports both dark and light theme basemaps for user preference.

Explore earthquake data efficiently with SwiftSOS and gain insights into seismic activity around the world.
